## Activity - Exploring 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq

#### Purpose

To explore bacterial diversity based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing using data from the “Impact of a 7-day homogeneous diet on interpersonal variation in human gut microbiomes and metabolomes” by Guthrie et al., 2023. This study is also referred to as the MISO study for “Microbiome Individuality and Stability Over Time” because the study aims to understand variation (or stability) of microbiomes across individuals.

This activity aims to explore and profile the metagenomic diversity using the R/Bioconductor package phyloseq which leverages various R-based tools to produce publication-quality taxonomy profiling and analysis  graphics.

### Learning objectives

1. Use phyloseq to explore data associated with Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs).
1. In phyloseq, subset data based on metadata and taxonomy.
1. In phyloseq, profile and plot taxonomy.

### Introduction

The most popular sequencing technique for the analysis of bacterial diversity is targeted sequencing, or sequencing of a specific gene (or region of a gene, e.g. a hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal rRNA gene) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to create sequences called amplicons. Sequence variation in the resulting amplicons creates amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). ASVs varying from as little as one single nucleotide can be defined as separate ASVs, which can be further clustered into OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) based on sequence similarity; e.g. as ASVs within 1% sequence difference can clustered into the same species/OTU.

### Activity 2 – Try it out questions

*Estimated time: 60 min*

With your group, perform some exploratory data analysis selecting from one of the four questions below or coming up with your own question.  Each question has its own section with code templates for you to use below. Select a question here, then go to the page specific to your question.

#### Question 1. What has more impact on human microbial variation, diet or individuality?

Diet is suggested to play an important role in shaping the human gut microbiome. However, other factors that are specific to an individual such as their physical fitness, metabolism, and genotype are also suspected to play a strong role. Here we will explore the impact of diet and individuality on human gut microbiome.

Approach: Examine high-level (Phylum) taxonomy for 5 timepoints and 21 individuals and evaluate if the change of diet or inter-individual differences have more impact on microbe variation.

1. Evaluate the effect of diet – Plot the three dietary groups BD, HD, and WO corresponding to 5 experimental timepoints (where timepoints 1 and 2 are BD, timepoints 3 and 4 are HD and timepoint 5 is WO).
1. Evaluate the effect of individuality – Plot the microbiome for all 21 individuals but focus on just the HD timepointgroup (where diet is the same).

#### Question 2. What are some of the most abundant microbes when viewed at different taxonomic resolutions? 

Microbes within the core microbiome - the most common and abundant species across samples in a given group - are likely to be involved in key functions of the holobiont.  Here we will explore some of the most common microbes at increasing levels of taxonomic resolution.

Approach: Examine microbial composition for most abundant taxonomic ranks in the human gut of the 21 individuals. To do so, you will use progressive sub-setting of the most abundant taxonomic ranks ranging from Phylum down to Species.

1. Plot all the Phyla and identify the most abundant Phylum
1. Subset the most abundant Phylum, and plot all the Orders
1. Subset the most abundant Order, and plot all the Families
1. Subset the most abundant Family, and plot all the Genera
1. Subset the most abundant Genus, and plot all the Species

#### Question 3. Does gender have an impact on the human gut microbiome? 

The biological sex of the host has been suggested to help shape or influence its gut microbiome. Some candidate microbes have been implicated in sex differences. Here we will explore the potential gender-based differences in the human gut microbiome.

Approach: Test if Phyla and/or species vary based on gender. First you will survey the differences between male and female subjects in the composition of their Phylum and species. Then you will select some candidate microbes of interest to examine in further detail.

1. Survey differences in phylum and species composition by gender.
1. Plot differences in species for a high abundance phylum by gender.
1. Plot differences in species for a low abundance phylum by gender.
1. Plot two candidate microbes reported in the literature to vary with gender.

#### Question 4. Does age have an impact on human gut microbiomes?

The human gut microbiome has been associated with age-related disease states, immune-system changes, and metabolic function. Here we will explore the potential microbiome changes associated with aging. 

Approach: Test if Phylum and/or species composition differs by age across the dataset. First you will plot the relationship between age and phylum; we will see that age is a more challenging variable to work with than our categorical variables. You will collapse and transform the data to fix this issue to create a final plot for your interpretation.

1. Plot all Phyla based on age.
1. Normalize age that includes multiple individuals to avoid overestimation  (e.g., 2 individuals are of age 27, 46 and 58, and 3 individuals are 54). 
1. Profile candidate Phyla Firmicutes based on age.
1. Profile candidate Phyla Bacteroidetes based on age.

## Try it Question 1 - What has more impact on human microbial variation, diet or individuality

Diet is suggested to play an important role in shaping the human gut microbiome. However, other factors that are specific to an individual such as their physical fitness, metabolism, and genotype are also suspected to play a strong role. Here we will explore the impact of diet and individuality on the human gut microbiome.

Approach: Plot high level taxa (Phyla) for all timepoints and subjects and compare the plots to determine which factor has a stronger effect on microbiome composition.

### Step 1A: Plot high-level taxonomy (Phylum level) for each  timepoint using the plot_bar() function.** Specifically, your plot should show Phyla diversity across all 5 timepoints. 

- Refer to the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the plot_bar() function.
- Ensure your plot has a title
- Remember, the BD diet includes timepoints 1 and 2, the HD diet includes timepoints 3 and 4, and the WO diet includes timepoint 5.
- Use the following code as a template:


``` r
plot_bar(miso, "fill in the blank", fill = "fill in the blank", title = "choose a name for your graph") + 
geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = "identity", position = "stack")
```

|**1A-1. Paste figure 1A below.**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**1A-2. Does the gut microbiome at the phyla-level look similar for the two samples within the baseline diet treatment (timepoints 1&2)?**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**1A-3. Does the gut microbiome at the phyla-level look similar for the two samples within the homogenous diet treatment (timepoints 3&4)?**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**1A-4. Does the gut microbiome at the phyla-level look different between diet treatments (timepoints  1 & 2 vs. 3 & 4 vs 5?)**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**1A-5 Based on what you wrote above, conclude the effect of diet on the gut microbiome at the level of phylum.**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>


### Step 1B: Plot high-level taxonomy (Phylum level) for each individual, using only normalized homogenized diet “HD” timepoints to minimize contribution of diet to the analysis using the plot_bar() function. 


``` r
misoHD = subset_samples(miso, diet == "HD")
plot_bar(misoHD, "fill in the blank", fill = "fill in the blank", title = "choose a name for your graph") + 
geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = "identity", position = "stack")
```

- Specifically, your plot should show Phyla diversity across all 21 individuals at HD timepoints. 
- Refer to the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the plot_bar() function.
- Check that your plot has a title
- Use the command below to create a phyloseq object with only “HD” timepoints and fill in the template code to make your plot.


|**1B-1. Paste your Figure 1B below:**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**1B-2. How different is the gut microbiome between subjects?**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**1B-3. Based on this figure, what is the effect of the  individual on the gut microbiome composition at the level of phylum?** Remember, this figure contains data for subjects who were all eating the same homogenized diet. So, the effect of diet is controlled for here and we can see the effect of the individual, which encompasses their lifestyle, genetic factors, age, and unique biology.|

## Try it Question 2 - What are some of the most abundant microbes when viewed at different taxonomic resolutions

Microbes within the core microbiome - the most common and abundant species across samples in a given group - are likely to be involved in key functions of the holobiont.  Here we will explore some of the most common microbes at increasing levels of taxonomic resolution.

Approach: Plot progressively lower level taxa for all individuals, subsetting most abundant from each rank. 

### Step 2A. Plot Phyla across all subjects and identify the most abundant Phyla. Specifically, your plot should show Phyla diversity across all 21 individuals. 

- Refer to the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the plot_bar() function.

- Use the following code as a template:


``` r
plot_bar(miso, "fill in the blank", fill = "fill in the blank", title = "choose a name for your graph") + 
geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = "identity", position = "stack")
```

|**2A-1. Insert the resulting plot below:**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**2A-2. Enter the name of the most abundant Phyla below:**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

### Step 2B. Subset the most abundant Phyla, and plot Order (Skip Class)

- Refer to the “Subset taxonomy” section of the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the subset_taxa and  plot_bar() functions.

- Use the following code as a template:


``` r
subset = subset_taxa(miso, Phylum == "fill in the blank")
plot_bar(subset, "subject", fill = "Order", title = "choose a name for your graph") + 
  geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = "identity", position = "stack")
```

|**2B-1. Insert the resulting plot below. Your plot’s abundance should be more varied and less than all the previous plots you have made so far, as it is only including a subset of the overall dataset.**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**2B-2. Enter the name of the most abundant Order of your chosen phylum below:**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

#### Step 2C. Subset the most abundant Order, and plot associated Family

- Refer to the “Subset taxonomy” section of the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the subset_taxa and  plot_bar() functions.

- Use the following code as a template:


``` r
subset = subset_taxa(miso, Order == "fill in the blank")
plot_bar(subset, "subject", fill = "Family", title = "choose a name for your graph") + 
  geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = "identity", position = "stack")
```

|**2C-1. Insert the resulting plot below:**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**2C-2. Enter the name of the most abundant Family below:**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

#### Step 2D.  Subset most abundant Family, and plot associated Genus

- Refer to the “Subset taxonomy” section of the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the subset_taxa and  plot_bar() functions.

- Use the following code as a template:


``` r
subset = subset_taxa(miso, Family == "fill in the blank")
plot_bar(subset, "subject", fill = "Genus", title = "choose a name for your graph") + 
  geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = "identity", position = "stack")
```

|2D-1. Insert the resulting plot below:|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|2D-2. Enter the name of the most abundant Genus of your chosen Family below:|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

#### Step 2E.  Subset the most abundant Genus, and plot associated Species

- Refer to the “Subset taxonomy” section of the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the subset_taxa and  plot_bar() functions.

- Use the following code as a template:


``` r
subset = subset_taxa(miso, Genus == "fill in the blank")
plot_bar(subset, "subject", fill = "Species", title = "choose a name for your graph") + 
  geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = "identity", position = "stack")+
theme(legend.text=element_text(size=6)) + 
theme(legend.key.size = unit(6, "pt"))
```

- Note, given the many different Species associated with an abundant Genus, we may need to reduce the legend text and key size in order to visualize the plot better. We have added some code above to help see the legend.

|**2E-1. Insert the resulting plot below:**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**2E-2. Enter the name of the some of the most abundant species below:**|

|**2E-3. After looking through all your plots, summarize your conclusion regarding individual microbiome composition diversity. Explain what reasoning led you to your conclusion.**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**2E-4. If an ASV is listed as NA at a given taxonomic rank, it means taxonomic information is not available at that level for that microbe. Are there are lot of ASVs with NA annotations across different levels?**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**2E-5. Look up one of the species you found. How might it serve a function in the gut microbiome?**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>



## Try it Question 3 - Does gender contribute to individual microbiome variation

The biological sex of the host has been suggested to help shape or influence its gut microbiome. Some candidate microbes have been implicated in sex differences. Here we will explore the potential sex-based differences in the human gut microbiome.

Approach: First survey the differences in microbiome across gender at the level of phyla and species, and identify potential candidates that may differ between males and females. Then, plot your candidates of interest  and additional candidate microbes previously associated with  gender-based variation.

#### Step 3A. Perform an initial survey to see if there are any differences in phyla and species composition between genders.

Specifically, your plot should show phyla diversity within male and female groups.

- Refer to the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the plot_bar() function.

- Use the following code as a template:


``` r
plot_bar(miso, "fill in the blank", fill = "fill in the blank", title = "fill in the blank") + 
geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = "identity", position = "stack")
```

|**3A-1. Insert the resulting plot below:**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

Consider any initial differences you see, then choose one high-abundant and one low-abundant candidate Phylum that shows hints of being differentially abundant between genders.

|**3A-2. Record the phylum you chose:**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

#### Step 3B. Test gender-based difference in Species for the high abundant phylum you selected. Specifically, your plot should show species diversity within male and female groups for only your phylum of choice.

- Refer to the “Subset taxonomy” section of the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the subset_taxa and  plot_bar() functions.

- Use the following code as a starter:


``` r
subset = subset_taxa(miso, Phylum == "fill in the blank")

plot_bar(subset, "fill in the blank", fill = "Species", title = "choose a name for your graph") + 
  geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = "identity", position = "stack")+
theme(legend.text=element_text(size=6)) + 
theme(legend.key.size = unit(6, "pt"))
```

- We may need to reduce the legend text and key size in order to visualize the plot better. We have added some code above to help see the legend.

|**3B-1. Insert the resulting plot below:**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**3B-2. Do you observe any differences in species based on gender within your highly abundant phylum?**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

### Step 3C. Test gender-based difference in Species for the low abundant phylum you selected.** Specifically, your plot should show species diversity within male and female groups for only your phylum of choice.

- Refer to the “Subset taxonomy” section of the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the subset_taxa and  plot_bar() functions.

- Use the code you used in Step 3B as a template for your code

- You may receive an error if you chose a phylum that has no species data (all NA). Please choose a new low abundant phylum and try again.

|**3C-1. Insert the resulting plot below:**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**3C-2. Do you observe any differences in species based on gender within your low abundant phylum?**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

### Step 3D:  Plot the individual abundance of 2 candidate microbes for gender differences based on your analysis above, and/or the curated menu of microbes below (previously associated with gender variation), with color denoting gender. 

- Specifically, your plot should show the chosen microbial group across 21 subjects with the bars colored by gender.

- Refer to the “Subset taxonomy” section of the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the subset_taxa and  plot_bar() functions.

- Use the following code as a template:


``` r
subset = subset_taxa(miso,  Phylum == "fill in the blank")
plot_bar(subset, "subject", fill = "gender", title = "fill in the blank") + 
 geom_bar(aes(color = gender, fill = gender), stat = "identity", position = "stack")
```

Here is the candidate list of different microbes previously implicated in  gender-based variation. 

- Phylum: Proteobacteria
- Order: Clostridiales
- Family: Ruminococcaceae
- Genus: Prevotella
- Genus: Fusobacterium
- Species: muciniphila 

|**3D-1. Insert the plot from your first chosen microbial group below. Your plot should have subjects on the x-axis, with each subject denoted as male or female by a colored bar. The height of the bars will vary.**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**3D-2. Insert the plot from your second chosen microbial group below: Your plot should have subjects on the x-axis, with each subject denoted as male or female by a colored bar. The height of the bars will vary.**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**3D-3. Based on the all graphs you made, did you identify any candidate Phylum or Species that may differ between genders?**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**3D-4. Based on the graphs you made, what conclusion can you make about microbiome differences  between genders? Do you think gender is connected to a difference in the gut microbiome?**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**3D-5. Which seems to have more effect on microbial compositions? Gender or individual subject? Are there bigger differences between genders or between individuals of the same gender?**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>


## Try it Question 4 - Does age contribute to individual microbiome variation

The human gut microbiome has been associated with age-related disease states, immune-system changes, and metabolic function. Here we will explore the potential microbiome changes associated with aging. 

Approach: Survey the differences in microbiome across age, refining the plot to accommodate a continuous variable (age) and unequal sample sizes (some individuals in the study are the same age). Then, test if there is a shift in microbiome abundance of phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, two phyla suggested previously to change with age. 

### Step 4A. Perform an initial survey to see if there are any differences in phyla related to age. 

Specifically, your plot should show the relationship phyla diversity and age of an individual.

- Refer to the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the plot_bar() function.
- Use the following code as a template
plot_bar(miso, "fill in the blank", fill = "fill in the blank", title = "fill in the blank") + 
geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = "identity", position = "stack")



``` r
plot_bar(miso, "fill in the blank", fill = "fill in the blank", title = "fill in the blank") + 
geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = "identity", position = "stack")
```

|**4A-1. Insert the resulting plot below: It will be a very unusual looking graph!**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

- You probably found it difficult to discern any differences.
- Abundance is additive, so having more samples of the same age will result in adding the abundances together, so if there are say 2 samples with age 27 (as is the case), the abundance of the bar will be much higher than other ages that have only one individual.

### Step 4B.  Merge samples by age, then re-normalize and finally re-plot Phyla by age.

1. Merge samples of the same age, saving  the resulting phyloseq object as ‘merge’. You will probably get a warning message letting you know “NAs were introduced by coercion.” That is OK.


``` r
merge <- merge_samples(miso, "age")
```

2. Check your merged phyloseq object.  Your new  ‘merge’ object should have 16 samples corresponding to 16 unique ages in the MISO dataset.


``` r
merge

phyloseq-class experiment-level object
otu_table()   OTU Table:         [ 1702 taxa and 16 samples ]
sample_data() Sample Data:       [ 16 samples by 32 sample variables ]
tax_table()   Taxonomy Table:    [ 1702 taxa by 9 taxonomic ranks ]
```

3. Normalize the sample counts using the function transform_sample_counts. Our function,  (100* x/sum(x)) will transform all the samples into proportions.


``` r
merge <- transform_sample_counts(merge, function(x) 100 * x/sum(x))
```

4. Re-plot Phyla by age.


``` r
plot_bar(merge, x= "age", fill = "fill in the blank", title = "fill in the blank") +
  geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = "identity", position = "stack")+
theme(legend.text=element_text(size=6)) + 
theme(legend.key.size = unit(6, "pt"))
```

- We may need to reduce the legend text and key size in order to visualize the plot better. We have added some code above in light blue to help see the legend.

- You will need to run all the commands in the same code chunk to produce the plot.


|**4B-1. Insert the resulting plot below:**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>


|**4B-2. Do you observe any candidate Phyla that changes with age?**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

### Step 4C. Candidate Phyla implicated in age variation include Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Plot these specific phyla on their own, separately, to observe any shift that occurs with age. 

- Use your new merged and normalized ‘merge’ phyloseq object as input. This means the new code must be placed in the same code block as the previous and run together.
- Refer to the “Subset taxonomy” section of the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the subset_taxa and  plot_bar() functions.
- Use the following code as a template:


``` r
subset = subset_taxa(merge,  Phylum == "fill in the blank")
plot_bar(subset, "age", fill = "fill in the blank", title = "fill in the blank") + 
 geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = "identity", position = "stack")
```

|**4C-1. Insert the plot that graphs the relationship of age to the Phylum Firmicutes below: The graph should have age on the axis, and just one color of bar that varies in height.**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**4C-2. Do you observe any changes in Firmicutes based on age?**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**4C-3. Insert the plot that graphs the relationship of age to the Phylum Bacteroidetes below: The graph should have age on the axis, and just one color of bar that varies in height.**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>

|**4C-4 Do you observe any changes in Bacteroidetes based on age?**|
|:--|
| <br> |
<br>
