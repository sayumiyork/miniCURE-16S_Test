"],["c-moor-overview.html", "Chapter 1 C-MOOR Overview", " Chapter 1 C-MOOR Overview 1.0.1 About C-MOOR C-MOOR is a project to invite students to join the data science revolution and be part of the next generation of data scientists. This project provides online materials to help students and instructors incorporate authentic research experiences in lower division courses. Over the years, C-MOOR has expanded its curricula to include RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, 16S amplicon sequencing, and WGS modules. Here’s some statistics about C-MOOR students: Students taught: 700+. 90% of our students are first years: We break the myth that only advanced-level students can perform and excel in real research. Student research posters: 100+. We choose a poster as our final deliverable to facilitate participation in research symposiums. Posters also allow us to evaluate the efficacy of our curricula over the years and make it easy for instructors to quickly and objectively grade student work. You can see a handful of posters here! 50% + Students choose to present posters at optional symposiums: C-MOOR posters have served as the impetus for establishing a new research symposium at Clovis Community College. Our students have attended and won awards at their institution’s research days and at conferences such as GRADS-4C and the ASM Maryland Branch Meeting. 1.0.2 Why data science? Data Science is an evolving career path for individuals (data scientists) in fields that need to manipulate large amounts of data. The job of a Data Scientist was called by the Harvard Business Review “the sexiest job of the 21st century” Data Scientists are individuals with a curiosity to look through data, identify patterns and develop testable hypotheses. In the Biological Sciences, data scientists dig through data to answer questions about health, disease, evolution, ecology, drug development, and much more. A currently relevant example is compiling and looking at the similarities and differences between the different SARS-CoV-2 strains and identify differences between strains that may lead to differences in rates of infection. 1.0.3 Learning Goals Engage with real and current scientific data Explore available research resources online Recognize the interdisciplinary nature of biological sciences Synthesize findings from scientific literature Summarize findings and discuss results with your peers Collaborate with peers on a data exploration activity "],["for-new-instructors.html", "Chapter 2 For new instructors", " Chapter 2 For new instructors Welcome to new and seasoned instructors alike! We are excited to have you use a C-MOOR module in your class. This section of our OTTR book is specifically for instructors and will help you prepare for teaching a C-MOOR offering as a part of your class. 2.0.1 Course-based undergraduate research experiences A course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) is a high impact practice (HIP) where students learn through authentic research. In addition to the standard concepts of the material and the technical skills required to complete lab exercises students gain critical thinking skills troubleshooting their research projects. They don’t just learn about science; they practice it! 2.0.2 How C-MOOR supports you Our curriculum is designed to be accessible for anyone to teach and aims to remove many of the barriers that prevent instructors from trying computational biology methods. No previous experience in bioinformatics required. We’ll help with the code: We provide all code templates required to complete the analyses. You just bring your expertise as a researcher! For support with code and other technical issues reach out to us with a post on the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum. Someone will assist you as soon as you are available. Our curriculum comes with lectures, assignments, and rubrics for you to use: We do as much as possible to take the workload of creating these materials off your back. But you’re not beholden to use them; if you have materials you’ve used over the years and prefer to use or want to use only parts of ours you’re free to do so. We designed our miniCUREs to be modular to fit into your course: Our miniCURE curricula are designed to be compact, with just 6 main sessions followed by project work. We’ve taught our RNA-seq miniCURE in pre-established classes, such as introductory biology. You don’t have to design your entire course around them and the modules fit easily into your lessons about gene expression and microbiology. 2.0.3 New instructor to-do list If you haven’t taught a C-MOOR curriculum in the past, here’s a list of tasks you should do, ideally before the semester begins: Make an introductory post on the C-MOOR Academy Discussion Forum in the general category. We recommend including: Your name Your institution The class you’re teaching that uses C-MOOR modules Your area of research expertise Any previous experience with bioinformatics The cloud platform you will be using to teach (see next item) Set up on a cloud platform: C-MOOR uses either SciServer or AnVIL for our cloud computing needs. If you’re not sure which is right for you, please mention this in your forum post so we can get you set up on whichever is more appropriate. Once you’ve chosen your cloud platform, follow the instructions in the respective section to access modules and learn how to grant your students the same access. While you can technically run the modules locally, running them on a cloud platform will prevent the need for students to download all the neccessary components and provides you easier access to updates. Go through the modules yourself: Familiarize yourself the curriculum and how to use the cloud platform and our fill-in-the-blank code chunks. Look through our resources and see what support is currently available; for example, our C-MOOR RNA-seq guide and our student made How To Get Started With Your C-MOOR Project Guide. Look over our generic C-MOOR Poster Rubric and alter it as neccessary. The rubric is designed so that you can choose what sections you want included in your students’ posters and what weight (point values) you want to give to each element. Students will use the rubric as a checklist as they create their posters. Some instructors share this rubric at the start of their class. Others may leave it until later. If you have a specific symposium or conference in mind, tailor the rubric to suit that venue (ex. if your school’s research day requires posters with abstracts and no introductions, change the rubric to reflect this requirement). Consider your syllabus and where each module fits into your class schedule. We provide estimated times for each module and the activities within as well as sample schedules from instructors who have taught the curriculum before. Some instructors teach a wet lab alongside the C-MOOR curriculum, using downtime (ex. waiting for the results of a gel electrophoresis lab) to do computational activities. Have students create an account on your chosen cloud platform and provide the neccessary information to you: Do this well in advance of the first day you’re using the C-MOOR curriculum to avoid technical issues on the day of (ex. students without Google associated email addresses on AnVIL, students who have unknown errors logging into SciServer). You will need to collect the students’ email addresses (AnVIL) or their usernames (SciServer). We recommend using tools in your LMS or a Google form to expedite this process.

Using AnVIL we can access computing resources on the cloud through your browser without need for any fancy physical equipment. Through AnVIL you will also have access to all the software and data necessary to complete your research project. In this section, we will set up our accounts on AnVIL and go through the entire lifecycle of an RStudio environment from creation to deletion. You will repeat this process throughout the semester; feel free to refer back to this section if you need a refresher on how to use AnVIL. "],["sign-up-for-an-anvil-account.html", "4.2 Sign up for an AnVIL account", " 4.2 Sign up for an AnVIL account 4.2.0.1 Purpose You will need an account on AnVIL in order to use the platform. In this section we’ll go over the specifics of account creation. 4.2.0.2 Learning Objectives Create an account on AnVIL Login to AnVIL Share the email you used to sign up for AnVIL with your instructor (if applicable) 4.2.1 Create an AnVIL account Follow the written steps below or refer to the slides or video guide. Open anvil.terra.bio in Google Chrome . Google Chrome is the only officially supported web browser for AnVIL. Because of this, while you can run AnVIL in other browsers you strongly suggest using Chrome. Tip: bookmark this page so that you can easily access it throughout the course. Click the hamburger icon (3 lines) in the top left corner of the screen Click “Sign in” Click “Sign in with Google”. Sign in with a Google associated email address such as an institutional email that uses Gmail or a personal Gmail account. You must use a Google associated email address to gain access to Google Cloud computing resources. If you are a student, share the email you used to sign up for AnVIL with your instructor following their instructions. Instructors should collect the student emails and use them in the next section, “Setting up workspaces on AnVIL.” Students do not need to set up a workspace, and should proceed to the section, “Running a module on AnVIL”. "],["setting-up-workspaces-on-anvil.html", "4.3 Setting up workspaces on AnVIL", " 4.3 Setting up workspaces on AnVIL This section is only for instructors. Students do NOT have to set up workspaces. Follow the written steps below or refer to the slides or video guide. 4.3.0.1 Purpose We will learn about managing students using groups and how to clone a copy of the C-MOOR workspaces for each section of a given class. 4.3.0.2 Learning Objectives Learn how to create groups that can be used to control users’ access Clone the workspace of your chosen C-MOOR curriculum for each section of your class Simultaneously add students of that section to the chosen workspace 4.3.1 A note to instructors on billing Instructors should have a Google billing account associated with their AnVIL account on Terra. We will not cover how to set up a Google Billing Account, which is separate from and required by a billing project. For assistance with setting up your billing account we suggest refering to the Terra (the platform on which AnVIL runs) guide to billing and speaking with your institution’s information technology and finance departments. Our team at C-MOOR is still piloting our curriculum on AnVIL. As such, we don’t have much information on the approximate cost per student. We hope to provide this data in the future. The best way to conserve costs is to make sure that students close out their session on AnVIL properly, including the deletion of the persistent disk after they are done working. AnVIL will continue to bill the billing project even if the environment is not in active use. For more information on how to control computing charges, please see the Terra guide: How to cut off GCP charges. 4.3.2 Using groups to manage classes We recommend you manage students and their access to workspaces through groups. When people are added to a group, they are given a new group email address that controls everyone within that group. For example, if there are 20 people in the group, all 20 are added at one time when the group email is used to give a group access to a workspace. Likewise, we recommend any management of students, such as removal or additions later in the class, be managed through the group interface. Access billing by clicking on the hamburger icon in the top left corner of the window, click on your name, and select groups. This will take you to this groups page. Click Create New group. You will be prompted to give your group a unique name. Click on the name of the newly created group to enter it. Click add users. Add users to the group using the same email they used to sign up for AnVIL. You can use the group email created for the group seen on the group management page to manage everyone in that group. For example, you can add everyone in the group to a workspace by adding this group email to the billing project. 4.3.3 Clone a workspace on AnVIL The instructor will clone the workspace in AnVIL. We recommend cloning one workspace for each section you teach. Each workspace can be shared by approximately 50 students without issue. You can clone multiple workspaces for exceptionally large classes. Students in a given section will use the cloned workspace for all learning modules and the research project. While logged into AnVIL, using the hamburger icon in the top left corner of the screen, navigate to the workspaces page Select the public tab Search for the desired workspace. Your instructor will tell you which workspace to look for (miniCURE-RNA-seq or miniCURE-16S-microbiome). Click on the more options icon on the right side of the desired workspace and click clone Give the cloned workspace a unique name. We recommend choosing the class and section name that the workspace is intended for. Confirm the billing project is the one you want to use. In this example, we have a billing project by semester and curriculum. All computational costs by students in the workspace will be billed ot this account. In the sharing step, add the students to the workspace using their group email. Refer to the section on managing students with groups for more information on adding students to groups. Make the students writers. Confirm that the can compute box is checked. This allows the students to computational resources on the cloud. Without it, they won’t be able to open any modules or run any code. The other options can be left as defaults. Finish cloning the workspace. Students should now have access to the workspace. To view your workspaces, click on the hamburger icon in the top left of the screen and go to the Workspaces tab. We recommend that any further management of people and their access to the workspaces be done by managing their group.

We will go over how to create an RStudio environment in that workspace to run the module and properly end a session on AnVIL to prevent runaway costs. 4.4.0.2 Learning Objectives Launch a module through the cloned workspace Close out a session on AnVIL properly to prevent runaway costs 4.4.1 What is a workspace? The workspace is the heart of AnVIL. Here are some key points about workspaces: Every workspace comes with its own Google Bucket (our cloud storage). Your bucket will be empty. Every workspace has its own billing project. Students who are not yet associated with a billing project will not be able to compute on their workspace. We can control access levels of users and set them either as owners, writers, or readers. Students will be writers with compute access. 4.4.2 Running modules on AnVIL 4.4.2.1 Starting a module on AnVIL When you open the workspace, you will be on the dashboard tab by default. The dashboard contains the instructions on how to use the workspace, links to C-MOOR websites, and the startup script. Let’s try running a module. Take note of the container image for the custom environment. We recommend copying this to a word document or notepad. Make sure there are no spaces before or after what you copy. You will need to input this URL soon. Take note of the startup script. Make sure there are no spaces before or after what you copy. This script is held in the original workspace everyone cloned. It does not have to be in your own workspace for it to work. You will need to input this URL soon. Click on the Environment Configuration button , the cloud with a thunderbolt. In the RStudio section, click Settings. Make sure you have the following settings matching these instructions. Under Application configuration, choose “Custom environment”. In the container image field that appears, paste the container image URL that we copied earlier from the workspace. The URL should end with Bioconductor 3.19.1. In the startup script field, paste the URL for the startup script. This URL contains the words C-MOOR Startup Script. Set the creation timeout limit to 15 minutes. Select 4 CPUs and 15 gigabytes of memory. Confirm that the cloud compute cost is 20 cents per hour. If it is not 20 cents per hour, reselect CPUs and memory allocation in part 6. This is a known bug in AnVIL at the writing of this guide. Scroll to the bottom of the window and click “Create”. It will take some time for the RStudio Environment to be created. You can keep track of the status of the environment based on the colored dot next to the RStudio icon. The dot will turn green when the environment is ready. While it is loading (blue), you cannot interact with it. When the environment is ready, use the Open RStudio button that will pop up. You can also access RStudio through the Analyses tab. If you hold down Ctrl as you click, you can open RStudio in a new window. Use the file explorer in RStudio to navigate to your module of choice. First, enter the folder of the curriculum you are using, either rnaseq (not cure-rnaseq) or 16s. Then enter the folder of the module you want to run. In the module’s directory, open the .Rmd file by double clicking its name. Click Run Document in the open .Rmd file When you are finished, make sure you close out your session properly to prevent runaway costs!. 4.4.3 Closing out a session on AnVIL On the right side of the screen, click the Cloud Environment button. This is the Cloud with the lighnting symbol. Under the RStudio section, click settings. Scroll to the bottom of the new window and click delete environment.

In this section, we’ll be exploring data from Impact of a 7-day homogeneous diet on interpersonal variation in human gut microbiomes and metabolomes by Guthrie et al. (2022). This study is one of many that explores the relationship between diet and the human gut microbiome and will help familiarize us with the format that 16S rRNA data takes. We’ll start slow and look at just a few lines of data in Google Sheets and then use phyloseq and DESeq2 in R to take our analysis to the next level. Human diet has been implicated heavily in the establishment and maintenance of the gut microbiome [REFs]. For example, human babies undergo a drastic change in the gut microbiome following the transition to solid food [REF], and microbes that assist in the breakdown of seaweed are found in Japanese gut microbiomes. It’s difficult to capture the mechanisms and effects of diet on the gut microbiome given the sheer number of variables involved. The microbiome individuality and stability over time (MISO) study aimed to explore the connection between diet, microbiome, and metabolites by looking at the effect of feeding a standardized diet to people over 7 days. 6.0.1 MISO study diet and sampling schedule The figure above shows the study design for the MISO study. You do not need to memorize all these details; feel free to refer to this page throughout the project: Participants eat their usual, baseline diet (BD) for 14 days Participants all eat the same diet, the homogenized diet (HD), for 7 days Participants return to their usual diet during the washout (WO) period for 7 days The study lasts a total of 28 days. Samples from the blood, stool, and urine, our metabolite and 16S rRNA data are taken at 5 different timepoints: Timepoint 1: Day 0 (the start of the study) Timepoint 2: Day 13 Timepoint 3: Day 17 Timepoint 4: Day 21 Timepoint 5: Day 28 6.0.2 MISO study variables and factors We have a number of variables we can use in our analysis.

Each ASV is a unique sequences that differs by as little as a single nucleotide from other ASVs and represents a specific microbe. We have assigned taxonomy to these microbes, but not all microbes have taxonomic data through the species level. These missing fields will appear as NA in the data. You may see the word Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) in phyloseq and in other published studies. ASVs and OTUs have some differences between them but they both represent distinct units of microbial taxa, although they have some key differences. Each sample is associated with a count of each ASV. We can compare the counts of these ASVs between samples to determine differences in the composition of the microbiome between samples. 6.0.4 Footnotes 6.0.4.1 Resources 6.0.4.2 Contributions and affiliations Sayumi York, Notre Dame of Maryland University "],["s-rrna-data-in-spreadsheets.html", "Chapter 7 16S rRNA Data in spreadsheets ", " Chapter 7 16S rRNA Data in spreadsheets "],["exploring-16s-rrna-data-in-spreadsheets.html", "7.1 Exploring 16S rRNA data in spreadsheets", " 7.1 Exploring 16S rRNA data in spreadsheets In this section we will look at 16S data in a spreadsheet via Google Sheets.

This study is also referred to as the MISO study for “Microbiome Individuality and Stability Over Time” because the study aims to understand variation (or stability) of microbiomes in individuals. This spreadsheet activity aims to orient you towards understanding the data and metadata content of this study. In subsequent activities, you will explore and analyze this data using the R/Bioconductor package phyloseq. Google Sheets and R are both useful for doing different analyses, so keep in mind the tools at your disposal and what will be the most efficient way to answer your research questions. Please note that this activity takes place in Google Sheets. It is possible to do the same analysis in Microsoft Excel although the individual steps you will take are different. To help make things easier for everyone, we strongly recommend everyone uses Google Sheets; all our instructions will be specific to Sheets. Students who do not have a Google-associated email address can sign up for a free Gmail account and gain access to Google Sheets this way. A Google Sheets cheatsheet that covers the necessary steps for this activity is available. Students who are not experienced using spreadsheet software should note that the instructions build on prior steps. 7.3.2 Learning objectives Explore Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) through the taxonomy profile of select ASVs, and sample metadata for a subset of ASVs. Ask research questions based on data and metadata How many different microbes (ASVs) are there in a given sample? Is there an even abundance of microbes (ASVs) in a sample or are there a few that dominate? How varied are ASVs and their abundance across subjects? How varied are ASVs and their abundance across diets? 7.3.3 Introduction The most popular sequencing technique for the analysis of bacterial diversity is targeted sequencing, or sequencing of a specific gene (or region of a gene, e.g. a hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal rRNA gene) using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to create sequences called amplicons. Sequence variation in the resulting amplicons creates Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs). ASVs varying from as little as one single nucleotide are defined as separate ASVs and as little as 1% difference in ASV sequence can be associated with different species. In this activity you will be exploring ASVs generated with sequencing 250 nucleotides (nt) Illumina sequencing, where Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were identified. 7.3.4 Activity 1 – Quick data overview based on 1 sample Estimated time: 10 min Although the full dataset contains 105 samples from 21 subjects and 5 timepoints (representing 3 dietary conditions), in this activity we will familiarize ourselves with the data by exploring data from 1 sample only. 7.3.4.1 Activity 1-1. Explore data contents using one sample only, namely MISO1-S02-1 (subject 2, timepoint 1). Access ‘MISO1-S02-1’ file and open it with Google Sheets.

This is the # of rows there are in the spreadsheet. Scroll down to the bottom of the sheet and look at the row number or select column A and see the count of all the cells in a row at the bottom right of the window. Remember to not count the header row. 1-1.2 How many microbes are there in this sample? In other words, what is the total number of ASVs per sample? We can count cells with a specific condition using the following formula: =COUNTIF(CELLS, “&lt;&gt;0”), where CELLS is replaced by the range of cells you want to use in the calculation. For example, for this sample (MISO1-S02-1) in cell J1 enter the formula =COUNTIF(I2:I2185, “&lt;&gt;0”). This formula says, count cells in the range between I2 and I2185 that are not equal to 0. Note that we do not include I1 in the calculation as that is the name of the sample name. # Microbes: 1-1.3 What taxonomy is associated with ASV1? Include all taxonomic ranks, even those that are listed as NA. Kingdom: Phylum: Class: Order: Family: Genus: Species: 1-1.4 What taxonomy is associated with ASV2? Include all taxonomic ranks, even those that are listed as NA. Kingdom: Phylum: Class: Order: Family: Genus: Species: 1-1.5 For sample 1 (MISO1-S02-1) what is the count of ASV 1? 1-1.6 For sample 1 (MISO1-S02-1) what is the count of ASV 2? 1-1.7 Are ASVs equally abundant throughout the sample? Plot the ASV count distribution (range of ASV abundance) for sample MISO1-S02-1. A) Make a bar graph of ASV distribution. Your chart should have the same format as the example. To make a bar graph with this data, hold the Command key on a Mac or Ctrl on Windows to select data that are not immediately next to each other and then click on columns A (“ASV”, which contains ASV ids) and I ( “MISO1-S02-1”, which contains counts) In the menu at the top of the screen, select Insert &gt; Chart. Make sure your graph is a bar plot: click on the 3 dots in the top right corner of the plot → edit chart and in the Chart editor, under Chart type, selecting Column Chart. Copy the bar graph into a box below: click on the 3 dots in the top right corner of the plot, select copy chart, then, paste it below. Your graph should look similar to the example graph with the ASVs on the x-axis and counts on the y-axis (although the Y axis is titled the same name of the MISO sample, since this is the name of the column). Insert graph here: B) What is the ASV with the highest abundance (count) in sample 1? To find this answer hover over the tallest bar in your ASV distribution plot from activity at its highest point. C) Describe the pattern of abundance in ASVs for this sample. Is the abundance of ASVs evenly distributed (left in the example graph) where each ASV is approximately the same abundance (count) or is the abundance of ASVs unevenly distributed (right in the example graph), where some ASVs have very high and/or very low counts? 7.3.5 Activity 2 – Explore variation between individuals Estimated time: 10 min One aspect of the Guthrie et al. study is the extent to which diet contributes to interpersonal microbiome variation (variation in microbiome between individuals). How does what you eat affect your gut microbiome? To this end, authors standardized the diet for all individuals with the same diet to evaluate how much of an effect the diet has on the microbiome. If people all eat the same diet, will their gut microbiome become more similar to each other? The study period was 28 days long and had 3 dietary conditions: BD (Baseline diet): which lasted 14 days (2 time points collected) and has participants eating what they usually eat. HD (Homogenized diet): which lasted 7 days (2 time points collected), and has all participants on the same diet WO (washout diet): which lasted for 7 days where participants choose their own diet again To explore variation between individuals, here we simplify the dietary variation to a single condition, WO. For this activity, the data file MISO_WO contains samples pre-filtered for WO condition only (and excludes samples corresponding to BD and HD). Since there is only 1 WO datapoint per individual, each WO sample corresponds to a different individual, so you should see 21 samples. 7.3.5.1 Activity 2-1 - What are the most common ASVs between individuals? IMPORTANT: An ASV is associated with an individual if it is NOT a zero. Zero means that particular ASV was not found in the individual, so you need to exclude zeroes from your calculations. A) Calculate the number of samples associated with each ASV. Record first 5 values below. Create an empty new first column for temporary calculations by right clicking column A and selecting “Insert 1 column left”. In cell A1, label this new column “Occurrence”. We will use the formula =COUNTIF(range, “&lt;&gt;0”) again to count how many cells have a non-0 value. For example, for ASV1 enter the formula = COUNTIF(C3:W3, “&lt;&gt;0”) into cell A3. If the formula and its placement are correct, cell A3 should calculate to 17 (so 17 of 21 WO samples have ASV1). Confirm your calculation is working correctly. Apply the calculation to all cells in the column by copy pasting the formula. For a reminder on how to do this, see the Google Sheets cheatsheet. ASV1: ASV2: ASV3: ASV4: ASV5: B) Calculate % of samples associated with each ASV and record the first top 5. record the first top 5. Create another new column by right clicking on column A and selecting “Insert 1 column left”. In cell A1, give the new column a name, “% of samples with this ASV”. Calculate % by dividing a value you obtained in part A) by 21 (samples) and multiplying by 100. To do this, starting with cell A3 (corresponding to ASV1), use the formula =100*(B3/21). Apply the calculation to all cells in the column by copy pasting the formula. For a reminder on how to do this, see the Google Sheets cheatsheet. ASV1: ASV2: ASV3: ASV4: ASV5: C) How many ASVs are present in all 21 individuals and what are their ids? To do so, find the number of ASVs that have a % of samples with this ASV = 100%. In cell A2 use the formula = COUNTIF(A3:A2186, “=100”). This formula says, count a cell if it is equal to 100. 7.3.5.2 Activity 2-2. Explore the taxonomy of the most common ASVs 2-2.1 Which ASV is found in 100% of samples? This ASV has a % of samples with this ASV = 100%. Hint: This ASV is found within the first 20 ASVs. 2-2.2 What is the taxonomy assigned to the most common ASV you found in Activity above? Return to your copy of ‘MISO1-S02-1’. Columns B-H correspond to taxonomic information. Kingdom: Phylum: Class: Order: Family: Genus: Species: 2-2.3 This ASV was found in every subject. What might this mean about the function this ASV plays in the gut microbiome? 7.3.6 Activity 2-3. Plot individual variation in abundance of the most common ASV. The most common ASV is represented in all samples, but does each sample have the same abundance of this ASV? A) Make a bar graph of most common ASV distribution across 21 individuals 1.Return to your version of the MISO_WO spreadsheet. Hold the Command key on a Mac or Ctrl on Windows to select data that are not immediately next to each other to select the header row (D2:X2, sample names) and the row corresponding to the most common ASV you identified above. In the menu at the top of the screen, select Insert &gt; Chart. Make sure your graph is a bar plot: click on the 3 dots in the top right corner of the plot → edit chart and in the Chart editor, under Chart type, selecting Column Chart. Copy the bar graph into a box below: click on the 3 dots in the top right corner of the plot, select copy chart, then, paste it below. Your graph should look similar to the example graph below, with multicolored bars that each represent one sample’s count of the ASV. The example shows a different ASV plotted with 5 samples. Your chart will have more bars and the legend may not be in the same place; do not worry if there is no legend or the legend text is not visible as in the example. Insert chart here B) Is the abundance of this ASV similar or dissimilar across samples? Each bar represents the count (abundance) of this ASV for a given subject. Ignore the axis title, which only has 1 sample name. Compare your graph to the example figure. Which is more like the graph you made? C) What might this mean for the function of this ASV in the gut microbiome? 7.3.7 Activity 3 – Explore variation within a single individual associated with diet Estimated time: 10 min Although the full dataset contains 105 samples from 21 subjects and 5 timepoints (representing 3 dietary conditions), in this activity we will zoom into ASV counts data for 1 individual (comprised of 5 samples representing the 5 timepoints collected from that individual). Timepoints 1 and 2: BD (Baseline diet) prior to normalization with homogenized diet Timepoints 3 and 4: HD (Homogenized diet): normalized to be same for all Timepoint 5: WO (Washout diet), subjects can choose to eat what they want again 7.3.7.1 Activity 3-1 Explore differences between dietary changes in one subject 3-1.1 Calculate variation in ASV abundance within individual 1 (MISO1-S02) and record the first 5 values below. How varied is the ASV abundance across timepoints? This involves plotting counts for ASV 1-10 for MISO1-SO2 timepoints 1 through 5. To calculate variation within a sample, we will use the VAR.S function in google sheets to calculate the variance of a sample. For more information on variance, see the Google Sheets cheatsheet. Access ‘MISO_Subject1’ Label an empty Column G by putting “Variance” in cell G1. Use this column to calculate variance. Starting with the first ASV use the following formula: =VAR.S(range) to calculate ASV abundance variation in the 5 samples/timepoints collected for individual MISO1-SO2. For example, for ASV1 enter formula =VAR.S(B2:F2) in cell G2. If imputed correctly, cell G2 should calculate to 14947547.8. Confirm this. Apply the calculation to all cells in the column by copy pasting the formula. For a reminder on how to do this, see the Google Sheets cheatsheet. Record the first 5 variance values below. ASV1 Variance: ASV2 Variance: ASV3 Variance: ASV4 Variance: ASV5 Variance: 3-1.2 Plot ASVs with highest variance. These are the ASVs whose abundance changed the most over the course of the study and could potentially depend heavily on diet. By plotting their counts, we will be able to see how the abundance of a given ASV changed throughout the experiment. A) Sort the ASVs by the variance column with the largest variance values at the top. Click on cell G2. Go to Data &gt; Sort sheet &gt; Sort sheet by column G (Z to A) Record the top 5 ASVs with the highest Variance and their Variance values below. ASV# Variance: ASV# Variance: ASV# Variance: ASV# Variance: ASV# Variance: B) After sorting ASVs based on high to low variance, make a plot of ASV counts corresponding to top 15 ASVs with the highest variance. To make a bar graph highlight top 16 rows corresponding to sample names and the 15 ASVs with highest variance, for samples MISO1-S02-1 through 5. Do not include the “Variance” column. In the menu at the top of the screen, select Insert &gt; Chart. Make sure your graph is a bar plot: click on the 3 dots in the top right corner of the plot → edit chart and in the Chart editor, under Chart type, selecting Column Chart. Copy the bar graph into a box below: click on the 3 dots in the top right corner of the plot, select copy chart, then, paste it below. Your chart should look similar to the example chart with different ASVs Insert chart here 7.3.7.2 Activity 3-2. Are there any ASVs whose abundance changes with different diets? Recall that there samples 1 and 2 are from the baseline diet (BD), samples 3 and 4 are on the uniform homogenized diet (HD) and sample 5 is from the washout diet. ASV_A in the example graph seems tightly linked to diet - timepoints from the same diet are similar to each other, and timepoints from different diets are different from each other. ASV_B shows a pattern that doesn’t seem connected to diet. Samples from timepoints within the same diet are not similar, while samples from different diets are. A) List an ASV that changes with diet and one that changes seemingly without the influence of diet: ASVs that seem to change in abundance based on diet: ASVs that seem to change in abundance that do not appear connected to diet: B) What factors other than diet do you think might change the abundance of a microbe in the gut microbiome? 7.3.8 Footnotes 7.3.8.1 Resources Google Doc ‘MISO1-S02-1’ spreadsheet MISO_WO spreadsheet ‘MISO_Subject1’ spreadsheet 7.3.8.2 Contributions and affiliations Valeriya Gaysinskaya, Johns Hopkins University Gauri Paul, Clovis Community College Frederick Tan, Johns Hopkins University Sayumi York, Notre Dame of Maryland University Last Revised: January 2026 "],["exploring-16s-rrna-data-with-phyloseq.html", "Chapter 8 Exploring 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq ", " Chapter 8 Exploring 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq "],["exploring-16s-rrna-data-with-phyloseq-1.html", "8.1 Exploring 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq", " 8.1 Exploring 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq "],["lecture---exploring-16s-rrna-data-with-phyloseq.html", "8.2 Lecture - Exploring 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq", " 8.2 Lecture - Exploring 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq Estimated time: Lecture "],["activity---exploring-16s-rrna-data-with-phyloseq.html", "8.3 Activity - Exploring 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq", " 8.3 Activity - Exploring 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq 8.3.0.1 Purpose To explore bacterial diversity based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing using data from the “Impact of a 7-day homogeneous diet on interpersonal variation in human gut microbiomes and metabolomes” by Guthrie et al., 2023. This study is also referred to as the MISO study for “Microbiome Individuality and Stability Over Time” because the study aims to understand variation (or stability) of microbiomes across individuals. This activity aims to explore and profile the metagenomic diversity using the R/Bioconductor package phyloseq which leverages various R-based tools to produce publication-quality taxonomy profiling and analysis graphics. 8.3.1 Learning objectives Use phyloseq to explore data associated with Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs). In phyloseq, subset data based on metadata and taxonomy. In phyloseq, profile and plot taxonomy. 8.3.2 Introduction The most popular sequencing technique for the analysis of bacterial diversity is targeted sequencing, or sequencing of a specific gene (or region of a gene, e.g. a hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal rRNA gene) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to create sequences called amplicons. Sequence variation in the resulting amplicons creates amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). ASVs varying from as little as one single nucleotide can be defined as separate ASVs, which can be further clustered into OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) based on sequence similarity; e.g. as ASVs within 1% sequence difference can clustered into the same species/OTU. 8.3.3 Activity 1 – Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq tutorial Estimated time: 25 min Explore a phyloseq object through the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial on SciServer.

Each question has its own section with code templates for you to use below. Select a question here, then go to the page specific to your question. 8.3.4.1 Question 1. What has more impact on human microbial variation, diet or individuality? Diet is suggested to play an important role in shaping the human gut microbiome. However, other factors that are specific to an individual such as their physical fitness, metabolism, and genotype are also suspected to play a strong role. Here we will explore the impact of diet and individuality on human gut microbiome. Approach: Examine high-level (Phylum) taxonomy for 5 timepoints and 21 individuals and evaluate if the change of diet or inter-individual differences have more impact on microbe variation. Evaluate the effect of diet – Plot the three dietary groups BD, HD, and WO corresponding to 5 experimental timepoints (where timepoints 1 and 2 are BD, timepoints 3 and 4 are HD and timepoint 5 is WO). Evaluate the effect of individuality – Plot the microbiome for all 21 individuals but focus on just the HD timepointgroup (where diet is the same). 8.3.4.2 Question 2. What are some of the most abundant microbes when viewed at different taxonomic resolutions? Microbes within the core microbiome - the most common and abundant species across samples in a given group - are likely to be involved in key functions of the holobiont. Here we will explore some of the most common microbes at increasing levels of taxonomic resolution. Approach: Examine microbial composition for most abundant taxonomic ranks in the human gut of the 21 individuals. To do so, you will use progressive sub-setting of the most abundant taxonomic ranks ranging from Phylum down to Species. Plot all the Phyla and identify the most abundant Phylum Subset the most abundant Phylum, and plot all the Orders Subset the most abundant Order, and plot all the Families Subset the most abundant Family, and plot all the Genera Subset the most abundant Genus, and plot all the Species 8.3.4.3 Question 3. Does gender have an impact on the human gut microbiome? The biological sex of the host has been suggested to help shape or influence its gut microbiome. Some candidate microbes have been implicated in sex differences. Here we will explore the potential gender-based differences in the human gut microbiome. Approach: Test if Phyla and/or species vary based on gender. First you will survey the differences between male and female subjects in the composition of their Phylum and species. Then you will select some candidate microbes of interest to examine in further detail. Survey differences in phylum and species composition by gender. Plot differences in species for a high abundance phylum by gender. Plot differences in species for a low abundance phylum by gender. Plot two candidate microbes reported in the literature to vary with gender. 8.3.4.4 Question 4. Does age have an impact on human gut microbiomes? The human gut microbiome has been associated with age-related disease states, immune-system changes, and metabolic function. Here we will explore the potential microbiome changes associated with aging. Approach: Test if Phylum and/or species composition differs by age across the dataset. First you will plot the relationship between age and phylum; we will see that age is a more challenging variable to work with than our categorical variables. You will collapse and transform the data to fix this issue to create a final plot for your interpretation. Plot all Phyla based on age. Normalize age that includes multiple individuals to avoid overestimation (e.g., 2 individuals are of age 27, 46 and 58, and 3 individuals are 54). Profile candidate Phyla Firmicutes based on age. Profile candidate Phyla Bacteroidetes based on age. 8.3.5 Grading criteria Download the assignment to your local computer as a .docx, complete it, and upload the assignment to your LMS (Blackboard, Canvas, Google Classroom). 8.3.6 Footnotes 8.3.6.1 Resources Google Doc 16S rRNA R Quick Reference 8.3.6.2 Contributions and affiliations Valeriya Gaysinskaya, Johns Hopkins University Gauri Paul, Clovis Community College Frederick Tan, Johns Hopkins University Sayumi York, Notre Dame of Maryland University "],["try-it-question-1---what-has-more-impact-on-human-microbial-variation-diet-or-individuality.html", "8.4 Try it Question 1 - What has more impact on human microbial variation, diet or individuality", " 8.4 Try it Question 1 - What has more impact on human microbial variation, diet or individuality Diet is suggested to play an important role in shaping the human gut microbiome.

Here we will explore the impact of diet and individuality on the human gut microbiome. Approach: Plot high level taxa (Phyla) for all timepoints and subjects and compare the plots to determine which factor has a stronger effect on microbiome composition. 8.4.1 Step 1A: Plot high-level taxonomy (Phylum level) for each timepoint using the plot_bar() function.** Specifically, your plot should show Phyla diversity across all 5 timepoints. Refer to the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the plot_bar() function. Ensure your plot has a title Remember, the BD diet includes timepoints 1 and 2, the HD diet includes timepoints 3 and 4, and the WO diet includes timepoint 5. Use the following code as a template: plot_bar(miso, &quot;fill in the blank&quot;, fill = &quot;fill in the blank&quot;, title = &quot;choose a name for your graph&quot;) + geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;stack&quot;) 1A-1.

Use the following code as a template: plot_bar(miso, &quot;fill in the blank&quot;, fill = &quot;fill in the blank&quot;, title = &quot;fill in the blank&quot;) + geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;stack&quot;) 3A-1. Insert the resulting plot below: Consider any initial differences you see, then choose one high-abundant and one low-abundant candidate Phylum that shows hints of being differentially abundant between genders. 3A-2. Record the phylum you chose: 8.6.0.2 Step 3B. Test gender-based difference in Species for the high abundant phylum you selected. Specifically, your plot should show species diversity within male and female groups for only your phylum of choice. Refer to the “Subset taxonomy” section of the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the subset_taxa and plot_bar() functions. Use the following code as a starter: subset = subset_taxa(miso, Phylum == &quot;fill in the blank&quot;) plot_bar(subset, &quot;fill in the blank&quot;, fill = &quot;Species&quot;, title = &quot;choose a name for your graph&quot;) + geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;stack&quot;)+ theme(legend.text=element_text(size=6)) + theme(legend.key.size = unit(6, &quot;pt&quot;)) We may need to reduce the legend text and key size in order to visualize the plot better. We have added some code above to help see the legend. 3B-1. Insert the resulting plot below: 3B-2. Do you observe any differences in species based on gender within your highly abundant phylum? 8.6.1 Step 3C. Test gender-based difference in Species for the low abundant phylum you selected.** Specifically, your plot should show species diversity within male and female groups for only your phylum of choice. Refer to the “Subset taxonomy” section of the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the subset_taxa and plot_bar() functions. Use the code you used in Step 3B as a template for your code You may receive an error if you chose a phylum that has no species data (all NA). Please choose a new low abundant phylum and try again. 3C-1. Insert the resulting plot below: 3C-2. Do you observe any differences in species based on gender within your low abundant phylum? 8.6.2 Step 3D: Plot the individual abundance of 2 candidate microbes for gender differences based on your analysis above, and/or the curated menu of microbes below (previously associated with gender variation), with color denoting gender. Specifically, your plot should show the chosen microbial group across 21 subjects with the bars colored by gender. Refer to the “Subset taxonomy” section of the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the subset_taxa and plot_bar() functions. Use the following code as a template: subset = subset_taxa(miso, Phylum == &quot;fill in the blank&quot;) plot_bar(subset, &quot;subject&quot;, fill = &quot;gender&quot;, title = &quot;fill in the blank&quot;) + geom_bar(aes(color = gender, fill = gender), stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;stack&quot;) Here is the candidate list of different microbes previously implicated in gender-based variation. Phylum: Proteobacteria Order: Clostridiales Family: Ruminococcaceae Genus: Prevotella Genus: Fusobacterium Species: muciniphila 3D-1. Insert the plot from your first chosen microbial group below. Your plot should have subjects on the x-axis, with each subject denoted as male or female by a colored bar. The height of the bars will vary. 3D-2. Insert the plot from your second chosen microbial group below: Your plot should have subjects on the x-axis, with each subject denoted as male or female by a colored bar. The height of the bars will vary. 3D-3. Based on the all graphs you made, did you identify any candidate Phylum or Species that may differ between genders? 3D-4. Based on the graphs you made, what conclusion can you make about microbiome differences between genders? Do you think gender is connected to a difference in the gut microbiome? 3D-5. Which seems to have more effect on microbial compositions? Gender or individual subject? Are there bigger differences between genders or between individuals of the same gender? "],["try-it-question-4---does-age-contribute-to-individual-microbiome-variation.html", "8.7 Try it Question 4 - Does age contribute to individual microbiome variation", " 8.7 Try it Question 4 - Does age contribute to individual microbiome variation The human gut microbiome has been associated with age-related disease states, immune-system changes, and metabolic function. Here we will explore the potential microbiome changes associated with aging. Approach: Survey the differences in microbiome across age, refining the plot to accommodate a continuous variable (age) and unequal sample sizes (some individuals in the study are the same age). Then, test if there is a shift in microbiome abundance of phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, two phyla suggested previously to change with age. 8.7.1 Step 4A. Perform an initial survey to see if there are any differences in phyla related to age. Specifically, your plot should show the relationship phyla diversity and age of an individual. Refer to the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the plot_bar() function. Use the following code as a template plot_bar(miso, “fill in the blank”, fill = “fill in the blank”, title = “fill in the blank”) + geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = “identity”, position = “stack”) plot_bar(miso, &quot;fill in the blank&quot;, fill = &quot;fill in the blank&quot;, title = &quot;fill in the blank&quot;) + geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;stack&quot;) 4A-1. Insert the resulting plot below: It will be a very unusual looking graph! You probably found it difficult to discern any differences. Abundance is additive, so having more samples of the same age will result in adding the abundances together, so if there are say 2 samples with age 27 (as is the case), the abundance of the bar will be much higher than other ages that have only one individual. 8.7.2 Step 4B. Merge samples by age, then re-normalize and finally re-plot Phyla by age. Merge samples of the same age, saving the resulting phyloseq object as ‘merge’. You will probably get a warning message letting you know “NAs were introduced by coercion.” That is OK. merge &lt;- merge_samples(miso, &quot;age&quot;) Check your merged phyloseq object. Your new ‘merge’ object should have 16 samples corresponding to 16 unique ages in the MISO dataset. merge phyloseq-class experiment-level object otu_table() OTU Table: [ 1702 taxa and 16 samples ] sample_data() Sample Data: [ 16 samples by 32 sample variables ] tax_table() Taxonomy Table: [ 1702 taxa by 9 taxonomic ranks ] Normalize the sample counts using the function transform_sample_counts. Our function, (100* x/sum(x)) will transform all the samples into proportions. merge &lt;- transform_sample_counts(merge, function(x) 100 * x/sum(x)) Re-plot Phyla by age. plot_bar(merge, x= &quot;age&quot;, fill = &quot;fill in the blank&quot;, title = &quot;fill in the blank&quot;) + geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;stack&quot;)+ theme(legend.text=element_text(size=6)) + theme(legend.key.size = unit(6, &quot;pt&quot;)) We may need to reduce the legend text and key size in order to visualize the plot better. We have added some code above in light blue to help see the legend. You will need to run all the commands in the same code chunk to produce the plot. 4B-1. Insert the resulting plot below: 4B-2. Do you observe any candidate Phyla that changes with age? 8.7.3 Step 4C. Candidate Phyla implicated in age variation include Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Plot these specific phyla on their own, separately, to observe any shift that occurs with age. Use your new merged and normalized ‘merge’ phyloseq object as input. This means the new code must be placed in the same code block as the previous and run together. Refer to the “Subset taxonomy” section of the “Explore 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the subset_taxa and plot_bar() functions. Use the following code as a template: subset = subset_taxa(merge, Phylum == &quot;fill in the blank&quot;) plot_bar(subset, &quot;age&quot;, fill = &quot;fill in the blank&quot;, title = &quot;fill in the blank&quot;) + geom_bar(aes(color = fill in the blank, fill = fill in the blank), stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;stack&quot;) 4C-1.

This study is also referred to as the MISO study for “Microbiome Individuality and Stability Over Time” because the study aims to understand variation (or stability) of microbiomes across individuals. This activity aims to analyze metagenomic diversity using the following R packages: phyloseq: A popular package for taxonomy profiling DESeq2: A package originally designed for differential expression which we will use for differential abundance ggplot2: A tidyverse package that produces high-quality figures 9.3.2 Learning objectives Use phyloseq to cluster samples based on the similarity of their microbial compositions using multidimensional scaling methods (NMDS or PCoA) Use phyloseq to profile alpha diversity (Shannon and Simpson’s indices) Use DESeq2 to perform differential abundance analysis 9.3.3 Introduction 16S data can be manipulated and visualized in a variety of ways. In Google Sheets, we explored the data manually to gain an understanding at the level of 1-10 ASVs. Through phyloseq we collapsed ASVs with the same taxonomic annotation to survey microbial diversity and perform the same exploration across the entire dataset. In this activity, we will use the functions of phyloseq and DESeq2 that are more advanced. These analyses would be extremely difficult and tedious to do manually and will allow us deeper insights into our dataset. We will cluster samples based on similarity of ASV counts, survey alpha diversity, and search for differentially abundant ASVs between different groups. 9.3.4 Activity 1 – Analyze 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq tutorial Estimated time: 35 min Activity 1.

Each question has its own section with code templates for you to use below. Select a question here, then go to the page specific to your question. 9.3.5.1 Question 1. How sensitive is microbial diversity to variables like diet, age and gender? Alpha diversity is a measure that estimates how the distribution of microbes changes due to a variable (or metadata category). Alpha diversity measures changes in the richness (the number of different organisms or ASVs) and evenness (how evenly are these organisms distributed in terms of their abundance). Using the “MISO” study dataset we will use Simpson (or specifically, Gini-Simpson) alpha diversity to evaluate changes in microbial diversity in individuals due to different metadata variables. Approach: Plot Simpson alpha diversity using plot_richness() command in phyloseq and assess the impact of different study variables on changes in microbial diversity. Identify variables that impact alpha diversity. Visible shifts in alpha diversity suggest a shift in microbial diversity, and a higher alpha diversity value indicates an increase in alpha diversity (either richness or abundance). Evaluate the impact of diet on alpha diversity by plotting ASVs based on “diet” variable. Evaluate the impact of individuality on alpha diversity by plotting ASVs based on “subject” variable. Evaluate the impact of gender on alpha diversity by plotting ASVs based on “age” variable. Evaluate the impact of gender on alpha diversity by plotting ASVs based on “gender” variable. Evaluate the impact of gender on alpha diversity by plotting ASVs based on the 5 different levels of metabolites in the study (Creatinine, PCS, IS, HIPP, PAG). 9.3.5.2 Question 2. Do diet, age, gender and levels of metabolites correlate with microbe variation between individuals? A PCoA plot is a principal coordinate analysis used to represent similarity between samples (sample microbiomes in our case). Using the “MISO” study dataset, we will use the PCoA plot to summarize individuals based on ASVs and plot the resulting relationships between individuals. Based on how well color-coding the different variables matches the sample distribution on the PcOA plot, we will aim to help explain potential sources of sample similarity. Approach: Perform multidimensional scaling (also known as principal component analysis) to establish a relationship between the samples given multivariate data (metadata variables). Using a PcOA plot (via commands ordinate() and plot_ordination() in phyloseq), you will condense the original high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional one by converting data to distance map (matrix) with 2 dimensions, x and y, that best explain variability in your data. From your PCoA plot you will assess the contribution of different study variables to sample diversity and identify variables that correlate with sample diversity. In a PcOA plot, samples with similar microbial profiles will be plotted close and may appear as groups. Make a PCoA plot, ordinate on the entire dataset (all ASVs) and color by individual. Investigate the shape of the resulting PCoA plot. Correlate PCoA plot shape with metadata variables by coloring the PCoA plot with different variables including diet, subject, age and gender. Do any of the variables correlate with the shape of PCoA plot and data groupings? Correlate PCoA plot shape with the levels of metabolites in the study (Creatinine, PCS, IS, HIPP, PAG). From the color-coding pattern, identify 1. which variables help potentially explain the data groups formed in the PCoA plot. Subset “HD”, ordinate on “HD”, and make a new PCoA plot. 9.3.5.3 Question 3. What microbes (ASVs) differ between males and females, and does age have an impact? Approach: Perform DESeq2 differential abundance analysis between females and males and determine how many differentially abundant microbes are there between the sexes. Then examine if age has a further impact on the differential abundance of the microbes between the sexes. Perform DESeq2 analysis between females and males and identify differences. Test if younger age contributes to differential microbe abundance between females and males by subsetting younger (&lt; 50 years old) individuals. Test if older age contributes to differential microbe abundance between females and males by subsetting older (&gt; 50 years old) individuals. 9.3.5.4 Question 4. Is there diet and age interaction and what microbes (ASVs) correlate with changes in diet-age interaction? Variables and conditions can interact with each other in complex ways. Here we will try to tease apart the relationship between the gut microbiome, diet, and age. What does an interaction look like? In this example, we’re looking at whether or not a change in diet affects people of different ages in different ways. We might imagine for example that a young person’s gut is more resilient to change than an older person’s or vice versa. Changes at one age group may be different in the other. Approach: Use alpha diversity measure and DESeq2 tools to answer this question. Using alpha diversity, determine if there is an interaction between diet and age. Then use DESeq2 to see if any ASVs are associated with changes in die-age interaction. Using Simpson alpha diversity measure (or specifically, Gini-Simpson) evaluate how microbial diversity changes with age and diet in general, or age and BD, HD and WO diet specifically. Then, use DESeq2 to evaluate if younger or older age changes ASVs associated with diet. Plot alpha diversity based age for the population in general, and then for individuals subsetted for BD, HD and WO diets. Look for shifts in alpha diversity with change in diet. Perform DESeq2 analysis based on the diet for the population in general, establishing baseline differential abundance between dietary groups HD and BD. Perform DESeq2 analysis based on the diet for the younger (&lt;= 50 yo) and older (&gt;=50 yo) individuals, evaluating age-associated changes in differential abundance between dietary groups HD and BD. 9.3.6 Grading criteria Download this assignment as Microsoft Word (.docx) and upload on Canvas 9.3.7 Footnotes 9.3.7.1 Resources Google Doc 9.3.7.2 Contributions and affiliations Valeriya Gaysinskaya, Johns Hopkins University Gauri Paul, Clovis Community College Frederick Tan, Johns Hopkins University Sayumi York, Notre Dame of Maryland University "],["try-it-question-1---how-sensitive-is-microbial-diversity-to-variables-like-diet-age-and-gender.html", "9.4 Try it Question 1 - How sensitive is microbial diversity to variables like diet, age and gender", " 9.4 Try it Question 1 - How sensitive is microbial diversity to variables like diet, age and gender Alpha diversity is a measure that estimates how the distribution of microbes changes due to a variable (or metadata category).

Approach: Plot Simpson alpha diversity using plot_richness() command in phyloseq and assess the impact of different study variables on changes in microbial diversity. Identify the variables that impact alpha diversity. Visible shifts in alpha diversity measure suggests a shift in microbial diversity, and higher alpha diversity value indicates an increase in alpha diversity. Note, when plotting this data you may get a warning below. That is ok! Warning: The data you have provided does not have any singletons. This is highly suspicious. Results of richness estimates (for example) are probably unreliable, or wrong, if you have already trimmed low-abundance taxa from the data.We recommended that you find the un-trimmed data and retry. Refer to the “alpha diversity” section of the “Analyze 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the plot_richness() function. 9.4.1 Step 1A.

Is the alpha diversity metric for one individual similar to another’s? 1A-4. When the points for an individual are highly clustered, this means their gut microbiome has the same level of biodiversity over the length of the experiment (although the exact community of microbes may not be the same). Conversely, when the points are farther apart, their gut microbiome’s biodiversity has changed through the experiment. What does it mean to see a varied pattern of clustering across individuals in the study? 1A-5. Do you think a healthy microbiome has a high or low alpha diversity? Why or why not? 9.4.2 Step 1B.

Are the points higher or lower overall in one diet versus the others?) 1B-3. Based on the plot above does diet change how varied the alpha diversity is between individuals? (ex. Are the points more spread out in one diet versus the others?) 1B-4. Do you think diet has an impact on gut microbial alpha diversity? 9.4.3 Step 1C.

In a PcOA plot, samples with similar microbial profiles will be plotted close and may appear as “clusters”. 9.5.1 Step 1. Make a PcOA plot, ordinating on the entire miso dataset, and coloring by individual. Investigate resulting plot shape. Ordination is a term used to summarize a multidimensional dataset when projected onto a low-dimensional space (like X &amp; Y axes) and then observing any pattern the data may possess with a visual inspection. Subsequent coloring of the pattern with metadata variables can reveal underlying relationships between data and experiment variables. color - by subject Include a title for your PCoA plot Use the following code as a template: #Ordinate miso.pcoa &lt;- ordinate(miso, method=&quot;PCoA&quot;, distance=&quot;bray&quot;) #Plot PCoA plot_ordination(miso, miso.pcoa, color = &quot;fill in the blank&quot;, title=&quot;fill in the blank&quot;) 1A-1. Paste your plot below: 1A-2. Does the PCoA organize samples into groups? Is there any pattern? 1A-3. Do you observe any sample clustering by individual? This is represented by points of the same color clustering together. If so, give an example of an individual who shows this pattern. 1A-4.

How well is your data explained by the variation in the diet - look for signs of correlation between PCoA shape and variable “diet” representing BD, HD and WO diets.

Step 2B. Using the PCoA plot from Step 1, look for any correlations between the shape of your PCoA plot and gender? How well is your data explained by the variation in the gender - look for signs of correlation between PcOA shape and variable “gender”.

Color - age Include title name for your PcOA plot Use the following code as a template. To enhance the color range of the age variable, additionally included below (in blue) is the command to specify the color gradient with yellow–to-blue gradient.

Paste your plot below: 2C-2 Are samples of a similar age similar to each other? 9.5.3 Step 3. Using the PCoA plot from Step 1, look for any correlations between the shape of your PCoA plot and the level of metabolites. How well is your data correlated with the variation in the 5 metabolites: Creatinine, PCS, IS, HIPP, or PAG?

Paste your metabolite plot(s) below: 3A-2. Which metabolite did you choose to show and why? 3A-3. Are samples of the same metabolite level similar to each other? 9.5.4 Step 4. One way of checking if the metabolite levels indeed correlate with your data, is to see if subsetting smaller chunks or specific chunks of the data will still maintain the metabolite-data relationship or break it. Using the subset() command, subset out e.g. HD diet specifically, and then BD diet. Then, generate new PCoA plots and see if the correlation with your metabolite of interest still holds. Step 4A. Subset “HD”, ordinate on “HD”, and make a new PCoA plot. Subset data - by the diet “HD” Ordinate - misoHD Color - by your selected metabolite from part 3 Include a title for your PcOA plot Use the following code as a template: #Subset only “HD” timepoint from your miso data, creating a new phyloseq object called “misoHD” misoHD = subset_samples(miso, diet == &quot;fill in the blank&quot;) #Ordinate using only “HD” subset, creating a new ordination matrix called “pcoa.misoHD” pcoa.misoHD &lt;- ordinate(misoHD, method=&quot;PCoA&quot;, distance=&quot;bray&quot;) #Make a PCoA plot using your “HD” subset. plot_ordination(misoHD, pcoa.misoHD, color = &quot;fill in the blank&quot;, title=&quot;fill in the blank&quot;) 4A-1. Paste your plot below for HD subset: 4A-2 Are samples of the same metabolite level similar to each other considering only samples from the HD diet? 4A-3 Has the relationship between the metabolite and samples changed within the HD diet compared to the entire dataset? (ex. Have any new patterns emerged or disappeared?) Step 4B. Repeat the analysis on only the BD diet samples. Subset “BD”, ordinate on “BD”, and make a new PCoA plot. Subset data - by the diet “BD” Ordinate - misoBD Color - by your selected metabolite from part 3 Include a title for your PcOA plot Use the code below as a template. misoBD = subset_samples(miso, diet == &quot;fill in the blank&quot;) pcoa.misoBD &lt;- ordinate(misoBD, method=&quot;PCoA&quot;, distance=&quot;bray&quot;) plot_ordination(misoBD, pcoa.misoBD, color = &quot;fill in the blank&quot;, title=&quot;fill in the blank&quot;) 4B-1.

"],["try-it-question-4---is-there-an-interaction-between-diet-and-age-and-the-microbiome.html", "9.7 Try it Question 4 - Is there an interaction between diet and age and the microbiome", " 9.7 Try it Question 4 - Is there an interaction between diet and age and the microbiome Variables and conditions can interact with each other in complex ways. Here we will try to tease apart the relationship between the gut microbiome, diet, and age. What does an interaction look like? In this example, we’re looking at whether or not a change in diet affects people of different ages in different ways. We might imagine for example that a young person’s gut is more resilient to change than an older person’s or vice versa. Changes at one age group may be different in the other. Approach: Use alpha diversity measure and DESeq2 tools to answer this question. Using alpha diversity, determine if there is an interaction between diet and age. Then use DESeq2 to see if any ASVs are associated with changes in die-age interaction. Using Simpson alpha diversity measure (or specifically, Gini-Simpson) evaluate how microbial diversity changes with age and diet in general, or age and BD, HD and WO diet specifically. Remember, shifts in alpha diversity measure suggest a shift in microbial diversity, with high alpha diversity suggesting high microbial diversity. Then, use DESeq2 to evaluate if ageing changes ASVs associated with diet. Note, when plotting this data you may get a warning below. That is ok! Warning: The data you have provided does not have any singletons. This is highly suspicious. Results of richness estimates (for example) are probably unreliable, or wrong, if you have already trimmed low-abundance taxa from the data.We recommended that you find the un-trimmed data and retry. Refer to the “alpha diversity” section of the “Analyze 16S rRNA Data with phyloseq” tutorial for help using the plot_richness() function. 9.7.1 Step 1.

Insert the resulting plot below: 2B-2. How many differentially abundant ASVs were identified? This is the number of rows in the result table. 2B-3. Did a change in diet from BD to HD cause there to be a lot of changes in microbe abundance in older individuals? 2B-4. How do these results compare to the results when we looked at the entire dataset (2A-1)? 2B-5. When this analysis is repeated for a younger population (&lt;=50), 3 differentially abundant ASVs are found. Do you think there is a diet-age interaction? A reminder that an interaction would cause different age groups to react to the change in diet differently.

We advise you and your students to do this as soon as possible after the end of class while your research project is still on your mind. 11.4.0.1 Resume or CV? You may hear the terms resume and CV being used interchangeably. While both are drawn from the same information, they vary in brevity and focus. A resume is a one-page (sometimes two-page) document of your experiences generally used for jobs outside of academia and research labs. It’s not uncommon for people to have more than one resume, as it’s best to tailor every resume to each specific role you’re applying to. A Curriculum Vitae (CV) is an extensive document that can take as many pages as needed to list the entirety of your research and academic experience. It often includes sections that aren’t found in non-academic fields such as publications, conferences, and published papers. Most positions will detail which they require from applicants and most colleges and universities will be able to help you build either at your library or career center. We suggest that current students and recent graduates interested add their C-MOOR research experience to either their classwork or projects section. Remember to acknowledge the contributions of your team members if applicable; this does not count against you in your applications! Here are some examples of how you might word your experiences; notice how they’re similar to an abstract in just one or two sentences: An RNA-seq project: Along with a partner, examined differential expression data of the period (per) gene along the Drosophila melanogaster midgut from a published dataset (Marianes &amp; Spradling 2013) using DESeq2 and ClusterProfiler. We discovered an elevated expression of per in the anterior region of the midgut where the primary digestion and absorption of carbohydrates occur. Our results were presented as a research poster at the 2025 Kuntz Research Day symposium and have implications for using Drosophila as a model for the connection between the circadian rhythm and metabolic disorders. A 16S project: My group and I profiled the abundance of Archean ASVs in the gut microbiome from a published 16S study comparing the gut microbiota of people before, during, and after a standardized diet (Guthrie et al. 2022). As a part of this study, we created a PCoA and performed an alpha diversity analysis in phyloseq. Archean community members are often overlooked in microbiome studies; we found differential abundance in Methanobacteria between male and female participants regardless of diet and hypothesize this may be due to consumption of fiber reported by male subjects pre- and post-diet. A WGS project: Public data (SRA#######) from Robinson et al. (2021) was analyzed in Galaxy using Trimmomatic, Megahit, and Krona to determine the viral abundance in samples from tap water from various North American Lakes and make comparisons to lake depth. Viral abundance was correlated with geographic distance between samples; future studies could examine if this pattern persists in samples sourced from Europe and Oceana. Your blurb is a strong blurb when:   You credit the source of your data (Citation, SRA #, Project #)   You describe why your research project matters   You list some of the computational platforms or software you used Q: Will people think I am an expert in genomics and bioinformatics if I put my project on my resume/CV? I don’t want to look like a phony. A: As a current student or new graduate, you are not expected to have mastery over any scientific domain. What you are trying to show is you have taken an idea and brought it to completion, your ability to learn new concepts and skills, and your previous exposure to research. You can explain more about your role in the project in an interview. Q: Can I list things like R or Galaxy in my skills section? A: You can, however we suggest being explicit in your experience and add the level at which you feel comfortable with each respective platform. Are you R (Beginner) or R (Proficient)? Can you teach someone else how to do your project? Can you perform your project with novel data? How good are you at troubleshooting? This answer may seem contrary to the previous one, but remember that other people who are listing these platforms in their skills section includes computer/data scientists (majors) and bioinformaticians (majors), so people may assume mastery. Think about it the same way you would a foreign language. Spanish (Beginner) describes a different level of skill than ‘just’ Spanish.

Maybe you’re more interested in wet lab work, or a specific model organism. We encourage you to try all sorts of different opportunities even if you feel totally comfortable working with C-MOOR so you can better understand what kind of roles suit you best. This section serves as a guide for some common jumping off points to find outside research opportunities. 12.2.1 Research opportunities at your institution Many colleges and universities have research programs for their students or resources available to connect you to some. You can ask your instructor, adviser, or library for more information. Some popular programs include: Undergraduate Research Opportunity Programs (UROP): Which often provide a database or pipeline of research opportunities for students at the univeristy or from surrounding areas. Research experiences for undergraduates (REU): Similar to UROP, but generally open for a wider audience of students from outside the community. See the NSF REU website for more information. Opportunities come and go and often follow the academic-year in terms of availability. If you can’t find something immediately, keep trying! 12.2.2 Find a research lab to join You can choose to pursue additional research opportunities in what we consider the more traditional way: by reaching out to a professor or research scientist whose work you are interested in and asking if they might be willing to have you in their lab. As these opportunities are at the discretion of the lab leader they will vary widely in their scope, duration, and ability to provide financial support. An email to a potential research lab should contain:  An introduction about yourself (name, class year, institution, major)  1-2 sentences about your previous experience in research  1-2 sentences about why you’re interested in their lab specifically  A polite, open ended request to work with them Dear Professor Penguin, My name is Student, and I am a junior at My University majoring in biology (or other). I read your chapter on the genetics yellow-eyed penguins in Penguins: Natural history and conservation, and then checked out your profile on the University website. My interests are broadly defined in environmental toxicology and I am interested in the work you are doing using eDNA and studies on the effects of plastic on developing penguin transcriptomes. I previously completed a project as a part of an RNA-seq miniCURE and have some exposure to working with DESeq2, though I still have much to learn. My group and I profiled the gene expression of the genes XYZ in the Drosophila midugt and I presented our poster at our university’s research day poster session. Thank you for your time and consideration in reading my email. Please let me know if you are currently available to mentor an undergraduate in your lab and if you would be willing to have me as a potential student. I hope to hear from you soon! Don’t be surprised if it takes the researcher a while to get back to you or if they respond curtly. They likely get many requests and are very busy. Continue to reach out to labs and apply to programs; it is difficult to know when opportunities are available as funding fluctuates.

What is BioDIGS?: BioDIGS is a project from the Genomic Data Science Community Network (GDSCN), which aims to characterize the microbiome of soil throughout sites in the US while connecting scientists to research. What makes BioDIGS different?: Soil is hypothesized to be the most diverse system on our planet, and BioDIGS is gathering sequence data and matching environmental data to elucidate the connection of soil microbes to abiotic variables and human health. Students at participating sites can take the entire project from soil sampling all the way through computational analysis. Curricula and more information on how to get a soil sampling kit are available on the BioDIGS website.

Spreadsheets are used in nearly every field of study and in personal life. The two most popular spreadsheet programs are Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel. While they can do approximately the same things, the exact steps to perform analyses are slightly different. To keep things standardized between students we ask all students to use Google Sheets, which is also free for users with a Gmail account. This section will cover some of the basic functions of Google Sheets. 14.0.0.1 Right clicking? A traditional mouse has a left button, a right button, and sometimes a center button. Typically, you click with the left button. Right clicking refers to clicking with the right button. Modern laptops and tablets have translated this feature in different ways. If you’re not using a mouse or find that clicking with the right or right-bottom corner of the trackpad doesn’t work, try the following: Right click by holding Ctrl and left-clicking Tapping with two fingers as opposed to one 14.0.1 Getting a copy of the spreadsheet Spreadsheets are featured in some of our C-MOOR curricula. We keep an original copy of the spreadsheet that can’t be edited by students and ask users to create a new copy to do their calculations in. You will need to make a copy of the original spreadsheet in order to interact with it. To do so, in the top left corner of the window, under the name of the spreadsheet and to the right of the spreadsheet icon, click File &gt; Make a copy. This new copy is yours to keep track of in your Google Drive. 14.0.2 Basic spreadsheet terms Columns: Refers to the vertical groupings of data types and called by a letter (ex. Column A, B, C, and D. Rows: Refers to the horizontal grouping of data types and called by a number (ex. Row 1, 2, 3…). In this example data, each row refers to a pet. Cells: Refer to the intersection between a given row and column and can be called by a combination of their column and row. Example: B2 refers to the intersection of column B, row 2 (which contains “Dog”). Header: Used to refer to the first row, which contains metadata or describes the data in each column. 14.0.3 Summary statistics by row or column Clicking on a column or row gives you the count of how many filled in cells there are in the bottom right area of the window. Notice how there are 11 cells filled and reported but only 10 of them contain real data. Cell A1 contains “Name”, which is a label for what kind of data is stored, but not data itself. Keep this in mind when answering questions about count. If numerical data is detected, you can click on the field in the bottom right corner and toggle it to display the sum, average, minimum, maximum, count value, and count value only including numbers. 14.0.4 Adding data to cells To add data to a cell, click on the cell and enter your data. Confirm the entry with the “Enter” or “Return” key on your keyboard or by clicking or moving to another cell with the arrow keys. Notice: Above the columns there is a field where you can see what is in a selected cell. To add calculations to a cell, use the = sign. Spreadsheet software will treat any cell with an = sign as a calculation, and it will treat any cell without an = sign as text. To do this, compare what happens when you have cells with the following. 1+1 = 1+1 1+1 will remain at 1+1, where as = 1+1 will cause the cell to calculate 2. We can see the original calculation we put into the cell above the columns. Calculations only work for numerical values. Cells with invalid calculations will cause a pop-up to warn you the cell is invalid. To add calculations based on cell values, the formula must contain the specific cell. We can manually type out the combination of column and row that refers to a cell (ex. D2, or: Type = into a cell Click on the cell you want to use in a calculation Complete the calculation formula. Notice: The cell used has colored borders matching the formula. You can interact with these borders to select different cells and find what is currently selected. 14.0.5 Applying a calculation to many cells To use the calculation multiple times, we can do the following, all of which will copy the formula and carry down the selected cells so you don’t have to reselect the cells used for new rows and columns. Try the following below to see what we mean. Method 1) Copy-paste the cell’s contents into new cells one by one. You can copy the cell with Ctrl+C or right clicking the cell and selecting copy. You can paste the calculation formula into new cells with Ctrl+V or right clicking the new cell and selecting paste. Method 2) Paste into multiple cells at one time. If you have a calculation that needs to be applied many times, it can be inconvenient to paste a copied formula over and over. In this case, select multiple cells by holding down the shift key and paste into all of them at once. Method 3) Drag the contents of the cell to copy the contents to new cells. When a cell is selected, a blue dot appears in the bottom right corner of the cell. Click and drag this dot and the formula will be applied to other cells 14.0.6 Manipulating the spreadsheet Right clicking a column or row brings up a menu with options for adding or deleting columns/rows, filtering data, or sorting the spreadsheet. Add or delete columns/rows: Insert or delete a column or row. Filtering data: Filter data so that only rows that have a specific value are shown. In the above example, you could filter by species and retain only rows (pets) that are dogs. Sort the spreadsheet: Sort the spreadsheet based on the values in the selected column (does not work for rows): alphabetically (A to Z), reverse alphabetically Z to A), lowest to highest (A to Z), highest to lowest (Z to A). 14.0.7 Useful formulas in Google Sheets Calculation Formula Sum =sum(CELLS) Average (Mean) =average(CELLS) Median =median(CELLS) Maximum =max(CELLS) Minimum =min(CELLS) Count cells that meet a certain condition = COUNTIF(CELLS, “condition, where if true, the cell will be counted”) Variance within a sample =var.s(CELLS) 14.0.7.1 On variance Variance is a measure of how spread out or consistent a dataset is, and is similar in concept to the standard deviation of a dataset (although there are differences in how they are calculated). For both variance and standard deviation there are alternate formulas for datasets that comprise a sample - var.s (which is used above), and for datasets that comprise entire populations (var.p). We use the population version when our dataset encompasses the entire population that we are interested in. Make sure you select the right formula for the right question! The majority of times, var.s will be more appropriate. If you’re not sure what to use, ask your instructor. "],["figure-and-tables-guide.html", "Chapter 15 Figure and tables guide", " Chapter 15 Figure and tables guide Figures and tables are found in all forms of scientific communication: posters, papers, and presentations. The information on this page is specific to posters and papers, although a good presentation will build off the materials here. 15.0.1 Figures What counts as a figure: Pretty much everything that isn’t a table that contains graphical information: Photographs, charts/graphs, and diagrams (digital and traditional) all count as figures! If it’s an image, it probably belongs as a figure! Cleaning a figure: Prepare the figure in a program like Google Slides or Powerpoint that will allow you to change the text size and fonts; you can do this with a creative use of cropping and text boxes with a solid white background. Add notes and adjustments where they would make the figure more easily understandable (ex. ordering samples by group and labeling their groups). The most important thing is that your figure is at a high enough quality and resolution that the pictures and text are not blurry! Figure legends: Figure legends (also interchangably called figure captions) go underneath their figures. Figure legends should include the following (feel free to ask your peers or instructor to review your legends): - A comprehensive title in bold that describes what the figure is about or the methods used to make the figure - Text describing the main takeaway from the figure - Text describing the methods used to generate the figure if needed - Text detailing any other background information or methodology needed to understand the figure (ex. abbreviations, settings of a program, description of subsetted data) - The legend/caption goes below the figure Multi-panel figures: You may encounter or want to make a figure with multiple panels. These figures are a collection of figures that are denoted alphabetically (ex. A, B, C, D…etc.). Multi-panel figures often are used to save space or group related figures together. In most published work you will see only figures in panels; your instructor may allow or encourage you to use tables in panels for your project. Each panel is denoted by a different letter. The title is comprehensive of both panels. Bolded letters draw the reader to the part of the legend specific to each panel. The standard information for the legend is included for each panel. 15.0.2 Tables Tables contain information organized into rows and columns. Common examples of information that gets put in tables include: subject metadata (age, ethnicity, etc.) and sample sizes (how many samples of each condition) throughout the experiment. Tables generally stand alone and are not included in published multi-panel figures, though your instructor may allow or encourage you to do so for your project. Table legends: - A title that describes the information contained in the table - Any relevant background information including methods needed to understand the table. Examples: Abbreviations in the figure, settings used in a program, description of a subset of data used) - Legend/caption goes above the table.
