### Purpose

We’ve all heard the saying. The best way to learn is by doing. So, let’s jump right in and read a science paper! As you read through the paper, keep in mind that **you are not expected to understand everything the first time through**. We will go through the paper in detail in the lab. 

Reading this paper will give us a first taste of scientific literature and start familiarizing ourselves with the 16S rRNA analyses you will complete as a part of your research project.

## Activity - Scientific Literature

### Purpose
Examine research where a 16S rRNA-based approach is used to compare metagenomic diversity in children with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), before and after fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) by reading:
[“Fecal transplant in children with Clostridioides difficile gives sustained reduction in antimicrobial resistance and potential pathogen burden" by Hourigan et al. (2019)](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6790402/) 

### Learning Objectives

1. Understand the purpose and experimental setup of the paper
1. Understand the presented evidence (Figures and Tables) of the paper

### Introduction

In this study, the effect of fecal transplantation on microbial composition and diversity in children with CDI is examined using short read shotgun metagenomics. Data visualization and taxonomic comparison between the samples was performed using R-based phyloseq, a tool you will use for 16S rDNA amplicon-seq analysis later in the course. Using phyloseq authors measure alpha diversity between samples,  examine beta diversity with Principal Coordinate Analysis(PCoA) plots and use taxonomy barplots for comparing relative abundance of microbes.

### Instructions
Based on the study, answer the following questions.  The main text of the paper can be found below, in the  ‘Resources’ section of this assignment.
