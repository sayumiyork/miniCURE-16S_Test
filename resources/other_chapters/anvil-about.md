## About AnVIL

AnVIL (The Genomic Data Science **An**alysis, **V**isualization, and **I**nformatics **L**ab-space) is a platform created by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in collaboration with cloud computing platform providers like Google and Microsoft. Using AnVIL we you can access computing resources on the cloud through your browser without need for any fancy physical equipment. Through AnVIL you will also have access to all the software and data necessary to complete your research project. 

In this section, we will set up our accounts on AnVIL and go through the entire lifecycle of an RStudio environment from creation to deletion. You will repeat this process throughout the semester; feel free to refer back to this section if you need a refresher on how to use AnVIL.
